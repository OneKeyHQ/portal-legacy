    "fixtures.coins.btc.how": "How does Bitcoin work?",
    "fixtures.coins.btc.how.answer": "Bitcoin is a truly decentralized digital currency, which makes it unlike any other asset that has come along before. | The emergence of Bitcoin revolutionized digital currencies by decentralizing the bookkeeping process. The Bitcoin network itself does not play the role of a bookkeeper; instead, it shares user account balances and transaction information in an anonymous form to users around the world. This means that anyone who wants to participate in the Bitcoin protocol can download and run the free open source software required. | Bitcoin works by ensuring that this shared ledger can be continually accumulated: new transactions are verified, recorded, and then added to the ledger in order. Adding new \"blocks of information\" to an already existing blockchain is the heart of blockchain technology.",
    "fixtures.coins.btc.store": "How do I store Bitcoins?",
    "fixtures.coins.btc.store.answer": "You can store your bitcoins in a bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin wallets come in two forms - hot wallets and cold wallets. A hot wallet refers to wallet software that is networked, i.e., stores bitcoins online. Hot wallets are more convenient for transactions, but logically, they are more vulnerable to attacks because they are connected to the Internet. | Cold wallets are \"offline\" wallets. This form of offline storage is effective in preventing hackers from attacking. However, because cold wallets are expensive and require more technical knowledge to operate, they are also significantly less convenient for users. Hardware wallets and paper wallets are both cold wallets.",

Bitcoin runs on a peer-to-peer network where people can send and receive bitcoins without an intermediary (such as a bank, central bank, or payment institution). In fact, no centralized institution or payment system can control bitcoin. | Bitcoin is the first ever cryptocurrency, and on October 31, 2008, someone (or a group of people) published the famous Bitcoin white paper under the name \"Satoshi Nakamoto\". | The first line of the white paper reads, \"A true peer-to-peer electronic cash should allow payments to be made directly online from the originator to the other party, without going through a third-party financial service provider. | The Bitcoin network was officially launched on January 2009, marking the beginning of the cryptocurrency revolution.",

The blockchain enables the moving smart contract code to run exactly as programmed, thus avoiding downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. | The ethereum network went live on July 30, 2015 with 73 million ethereum pre-mined.",

    "fixtures.coins.ltc.store.answer": "You can store it in a cold wallet or a hot wallet.",
    "fixtures.coins.ltc.what": "What is Litecoin",
    "fixtures.coins.ltc.what.answer": "Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by former Google employee Charlie Lee in 2011. LiteCoin was created based on the Bitcoin protocol, but differs from Bitcoin in its hashing algorithm, hard cap, block transaction times, and some other factors. on October 7, 2011, LiteCoin completed its release on an open source client on GitHub, and five days later, on October 13, the LiteCoin network went live. | Lee created Litecoin with the intention of creating a streamlined version of Bitcoin. Litecoin developers often say that Bitcoin is gold and Litecoin is silver. Litecoin differs from Bitcoin in terms of transaction confirmation speed, with blocks coming out roughly once every two and a half minutes. However, due to network congestion, users may have to wait about half an hour for their transactions to be processed. | LiteCoin is already accepted by many merchants, and you can check the updated list on the LiteCoin Foundation website.",

Any platform (wallet, exchange) where you do not hold your private key is centralized and there is a possibility of single point of failure. Therefore, keeping your private key is the way to go. Even if you are now trying to make it convenient to hold your assets in a centralized platform, sooner or later you will have to keep your private key yourself. | As long as you take good care of them, no one, organization or hacker can take the coins away from you.

    "fixtures.questions.answer4": "Too many Internet companies take privacy for granted; too many users take selling their privacy for granted. | But it doesn't have to be that way. | You can even define your own nodes, servers, block browsers, etc., to synchronize data without going through the OneKey server. | We don't analyze or sell your personal data, we're not interested in your data.

We also say hello to strangers, spread out our hearts, shake hands and touch shoulders, greatly admire others at the first time, and look forward to the next reunion, so that each years we'll have more interactions.<\/p><p> We also say hello to the beautiful strange techs, whether it is 3D printing, gene sequencing, or virtual reality, they are passing through the darkness of the ignorant mind, in the wisdom of the candlelight in the view of the boundary of human imagination to the public life. At this point, hello to Bitcoin, a paper agreement that shakes the human desire for free money. This is the seventh year of its existence, and we welcome it, let it goes into the journey of our life, nourished and enriched by the years. We are the preachers of the new order of Internet finance, guided by free will, with the candlelight of continuity, shuttling in all directions through the dark forest, through the pyramid scheme Shaoze, and moreover, walking through the utopian wasteland with only one horse.<\/p><p> In the long river of time, the New Year's span may really be a small boat carrying, to another canoe of transit. Looking back at the journey Bitcoin has taken among them, the sweetness and the bitterness should be transcendent to the gladness.<\/p><p> This is the year that more countries, led by the United States, took an enlightened approach to Bitcoin.<\/p><p> This year more people use Bitcoin and enjoy the convenience and blessings it brings; this year, the Bitcoin's security is stronger, breaking 100 billion times, looking back to 2013 there are teenagers worried about the vulnerability of its system and constantly \"good morning Bitcoin\", \"good night Bitcoin \".<\/p><p> This year, bitcoin emerged from the general situation of the commodity gloom, and the price rose several times from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, becoming a foreign army of investment products, regaining the eyes of global investors. Granted, this is far from what we're after.<\/p><p> The moment guffawed, incredibly.<\/p><p> It is the simplest protocol, the origin of the Internet transaction. The world is a complicated place, and even with more skepticism, self-defense of interests, and resistance to temptation, the path of Bitcoin's development will encounter many of those people who, when exposed to Bitcoin, will have the same great shock as Colonel Aureliano Buendía's first touch of ice as a teenager. There is no intention to resist the financial order of this world, just the freedom to pursue and also have a choice of a financial order called Bitcoin.<\/p><p> As a Bitcoin practitioner, this year has had its share of chilly, sluggish intentions and controversial fractures. However, no matter the light or the scars, they are only minor details in the revolution of Bitcoin's blast forward. This year has been a year of deep contemplation of God's hand, insight into the language of the universe, abandoning the divine right of nothingness, and tired of the oppression of authority, choosing Bitcoin, a mathematical protocol, as a way to put all of our wealth to rest.<\/p>",
